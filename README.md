# Trading with Momentum

In this project, I learned to implement a trading strategy on my own, and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. I was supplied with a universe of stocks and time range. I was also  provided with a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator.  Then I computed the signal for the time range given and applied it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, I performed a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, I used the end of day from Quotemedia.

This project was the first (out of 8) project in **AI for trading NanoDegree Program**, offered by Udacity. The rest of projects could be found in my GitHub Page as well.
